# MCQsim
this repository hosts MCQsim, a multi-cycle earthquake rupture simulator for generation of earthquake sequences along predefined faults or fault systems of arbitrary geometric complexity.

We are currently putting together the documentation for MCQsim. That said, you can always reach out to us about how to use the code etc.
